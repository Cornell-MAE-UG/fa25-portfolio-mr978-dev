## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Morgan Remeza! I am a junior Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University, graduating in May 2026, with interests in aerodynamic design, energy systems, and experimental engineering. My coursework and projects emphasize translating analytical models into real-world performance through iterative design, testing, and data analysis.

I have hands-on experience across CAD, MATLAB, Python, and experimental validation, and I enjoy working at the intersection of theory, fabrication, and testing—particularly in team-based, technically rigorous environments.

Take a look at some of <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my aero projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
