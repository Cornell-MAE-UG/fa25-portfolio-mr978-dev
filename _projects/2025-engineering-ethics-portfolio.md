# Engineering Beyond Compliance: A Story of Responsibility

## Introduction — The Engineer at the Gate

Engineering decisions often begin quietly—inside design reviews, certification meetings, and software approvals. Yet some decisions stand at the gate between safety and harm. The Boeing 737 MAX case shows that ethical engineering is not simply about meeting requirements; it is about recognizing when compliance is insufficient to protect human life.

Across Weeks 6–9, the coursework emphasized that engineers occupy a unique position of trust. They see risks before the public does, and often before regulators do. In that moment, the engineer stands at the gate. Like an honorable knight sworn to protect the kingdom, the engineer’s responsibility is to those who cannot see the danger approaching.

## 1. Seeing the Real Threat — Framing the Problem (Week 6)

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/framing.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Framing the Problem" style="display:block; max-width: 750px; width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0.75rem auto 1.25rem auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

Week 6 focused on identifying and narrowing ethical issues with precision. The worksheets showed that vague framing weakens accountability. Asking *“Was MCAS ethical?”* spreads responsibility thin. Strong framing instead asks targeted questions tied to decisions and authority.

From the Week 6 analysis, five core issues emerged:
- Whether cost and schedule pressures outweighed safety
- Whether MCAS should have relied on a single angle-of-attack sensor
- Whether pilots and airlines should have been fully informed of MCAS behavior
- Whether inadequate testing was approved to meet deadlines
- Whether Boeing’s response after the first crash was ethically sufficient

These were not abstract concerns. Each issue directly connected engineering decisions to potential loss of life. Ethical framing required recognizing that single-sensor dependency and limited pilot awareness were not secondary details—they were central threats.

An engineer who fails to frame the problem correctly never truly enters the battle. Ethical responsibility begins by seeing the real terrain.

## 2. Understanding the Rules of the Kingdom — Facts and Assumptions (Week 7)

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/understanding.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Facts and Assumptions" style="display:block; max-width: 750px; width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0.75rem auto 1.25rem auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

Week 7 emphasized the role of facts, assumptions, and definitions in ethical reasoning. The worksheets demonstrated that many failures stem not from missing data, but from unchallenged assumptions.

In the 737 MAX case, several assumptions shaped decisions:
- That meeting minimum certification standards equated to sufficient safety
- That pilots could respond effectively without full system disclosure
- That redundancy could be traded for cost and schedule efficiency
- That regulatory delegation reduced individual responsibility

The factual record showed MCAS relied on a single sensor capable of triggering repeated nose-down commands. Engineers knew dual-sensor designs were feasible. The assumption that such redundancy was unnecessary reflected a narrow definition of safety.

In the metaphor of the kingdom, laws alone do not ensure protection. The knight must interpret the law in service of its purpose. Ethical engineering requires questioning whether accepted assumptions truly serve public safety.

## 3. Choosing When Principles Collide — Acting on Ethics (Week 8)

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/collide.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Principles Collide" style="display:block; max-width: 750px; width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0.75rem auto 1.25rem auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

Week 8 centered on resolving ethical conflicts using ASME canons. Engineers often face competing obligations: loyalty to employers, efficiency, and market competitiveness versus the safety and welfare of the public.

The worksheets repeatedly returned to ASME Canon 1: *Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.* In the MCAS case, this canon conflicted with pressures to minimize training costs, avoid redesign delays, and maintain competitive positioning.

Approving a safety-critical system with known single-point failure characteristics violated this hierarchy. Ethical action would have required refusing certification, escalating concerns, or delaying approval—even at personal or organizational cost.

This is the defining moment of the knight’s story. When principles collide, courage is measured not by compliance, but by refusal to proceed when safety is compromised.

## 4. Pressure from Within the Walls — Constraints and Reality (Week 9)

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/pressure.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Constraints and Reality" style="display:block; max-width: 750px; width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 0.75rem auto 1.25rem auto; border-radius: 10px;" />

Week 9 addressed practical constraints that complicate ethical action. The worksheets identified organizational pressure, job security concerns, regulatory ambiguity, and limited individual authority as forces that discourage resistance.

Engineers at Boeing operated within a hierarchy that prioritized schedule and competition. FAA delegation blurred responsibility. Information silos limited visibility of system-level risk. These constraints help explain why ethical failures occurred—but they do not absolve responsibility.

The coursework emphasized that ethical engineering must be supported structurally. Independent safety review boards, protected reporting channels, and clear regulatory authority are necessary to prevent predictable failures.

A single knight cannot hold the walls alone. Ethical systems must be designed so that doing the right thing is not an act of personal sacrifice.

## Conclusion — The Quiet Victory

The combined lessons of Weeks 6–9 point to a clear conclusion: ethical engineering requires vigilance, judgment, and action beyond minimum compliance. Engineers must frame problems sharply, challenge assumptions, apply ethical hierarchies, and resist pressures that place efficiency above safety.

When engineers act this way, technologies succeed not only technically, but socially. Trust is preserved. Harm is prevented. Professional integrity endures.

The honorable engineer rarely receives recognition. Like a knight who lowers their sword at dawn, they leave knowing the kingdom is safer—not because the rules were followed, but because responsibility was taken.
