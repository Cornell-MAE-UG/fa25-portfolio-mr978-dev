## Project Overview
As part of MAE 4272, our team designed, manufactured, and tested a small-scale wind turbine blade to maximize power output under wind tunnel constraints. The project emphasized aerodynamic performance, structural feasibility, and manufacturability within a controlled experimental environment.

## Design Process
The design process involved selecting an appropriate airfoil, defining chord and twist distributions, and predicting performance using simplified aerodynamic models. Iterative refinement balanced predicted power output with structural considerations such as root loading and stiffness, resulting in a final blade geometry suitable for fabrication and repeatable testing.

## Testing & Analysis
The blade was tested in the Big Blue wind tunnel across a range of operating conditions. Experimental data were used to generate performance curves and evaluate trends with wind speed, enabling comparison between predicted and measured behavior and assessment of model accuracy.

## My Contribution
I contributed to aerodynamic modeling, CAD development, and experimental data analysis, with an empahsis on structural analysis supporting the transition from analytical design to physical testing and performance evaluation.
