## MT4 Air-start

Experimental **multi-motor airstart project** focused on staged ignition for in-flight thrust control using **PerfectFlite MiniTimer 4 (MT4)** units integrated into the lower airframe.

---

### Ground Setup
Staged ignition system configured and verified prior to flight, with independent timers assigned to each outboard motor pair.

### Boost Phase
Vehicle boosted under a **central L1400 core motor**, establishing stable ascent prior to airstart events.

### Airstart – Set 1
**Outboard motors 1 & 2** ignited at approximately **2,500 ft AGL**, adding thrust during mid-ascent.
