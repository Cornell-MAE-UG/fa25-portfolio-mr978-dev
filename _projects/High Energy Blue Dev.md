## Project Overview

This project focused on the development of a **high-density, high-ISP (~230 s) aluminized composite solid propellant** optimized for small-scale high-performance rocket motors. The effort combined formulation chemistry, ballistic modeling, and hardware design to maximize delivered impulse while maintaining stable combustion and manufacturability.

The final outcome was a **76 mm × 1000 mm M-class motor (~9000 N·s total impulse)** featuring a machined phenolic nozzle with a graphite throat insert sized for an ideal expansion ratio. The motor was successfully flown in a **40 lb test vehicle to 16,500 ft**, validating both performance predictions and structural margins.

## Propellant Formulation & Optimization

The propellant family was based on a high-solids **aluminized “Blue” formulation**, incorporating bimodal ammonium perchlorate (AP) and catalyzed burn-rate control. Iterative testing explored solids loading, aluminum content, catalyst percentage, and particle sizing to balance **density impulse, burn stability, and structural compatibility**.

The final optimized formulation converged at **~85.5% total solids with 9% aluminum and ~1.22% CuO catalyst**, selected to:
- Maximize **density-specific impulse (ρIsp)**  
- Leverage **~3 µm aluminum** for optimal combustion and energy release  
- Use **bimodal AP** to increase packing efficiency  
- Produce a **tamer burn rate**, enabling tighter core geometries and increased propellant volume loading

This combination allowed higher delivered impulse without excessive chamber pressure growth or erosive instability.

## Motor & Nozzle Design

Motor geometry and internal ballistics were designed and iterated using **OpenMotor and ProPep**, with hardware modeled in **SolidWorks**. Key features included:
- **76 mm motor diameter, 1000 mm propellant length**
- Optimized core geometry matched to measured burn rates
- **Machined phenolic nozzle** with a **graphite throat insert** for erosion resistance
- Expansion ratio selected for near-optimal sea-level to mid-altitude operation

The nozzle and grain design were co-optimized to maintain efficient expansion throughout the burn while controlling throat erosion and maintaining predictable thrust curves.
